Shifts

Note: This program is designed for the arm chip, I'm personally coding on a Raspberri Pi 

In this folder, I will be showing various examples of shifts

Assume there's a file named "fileName" download
1. fileName
2. fileName.o
3. fileName.s

To run the program you have to do 2 things 

1. Assemble the program
Type: "g++ fileName.s -o fileName"
2. Run the program
Type: "./fileName"
